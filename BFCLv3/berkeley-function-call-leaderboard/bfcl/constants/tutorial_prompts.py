File System Tutorial:

To edit, create, or delete files, follow these steps:

1. Use the `ls` command to list all files and directories in the current directory.
2. Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you want to perform file operations.
3. Always ensure you are in the correct directory before editing, creating, or deleting any files to avoid mistakes.

Be careful to verify your current path before making any changes to files or directories.
