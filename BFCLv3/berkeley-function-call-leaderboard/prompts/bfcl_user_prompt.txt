Do you think you have well-explored all functions that you are interested in, particularly those with ambiguous input formats/structures or potentially unexpected outputs? 

Consider stopping (###STOP) if:
- You have thoroughly tested functions with unclear parameter requirements
- You have explored functions that might produce unexpected or variable output formats
- You have sufficient understanding of how to handle edge cases and errors

Continue exploring (###CONTINUE) if:
- There are still functions with ambiguous input specifications that need clarification
- You haven't fully tested functions that could have unpredictable outputs
- You need more exploration to understand parameter constraints and error handling

Please output ###STOP if you believe you have comprehensive coverage, or ###CONTINUE if more exploration is needed.
