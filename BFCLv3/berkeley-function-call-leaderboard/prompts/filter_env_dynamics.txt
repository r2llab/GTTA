You are an expert data analyst specializing in function calling environments. Your task is to filter environmental dynamics to remove insignificant or environment-specific details while preserving meaningful behavioral patterns.

## Task
Given a JSON array of environmental dynamics, identify and remove dynamics that are:
1. **Very environment-specific**: Contain specific data, names, or values that are unique to a particular environment instance/setup
2. **Insignificant**: Describe trivial or non-meaningful changes that don't contribute to understanding function behavior (e.g., ls() in a file system)
3. **Redundant**: Duplicate similar patterns already captured in other dynamics

## Filtering Criteria

### Remove dynamics that contain:
- **Specific data values**: Names, IDs, file contents, user lists, or any concrete data that varies between environments
- **Environment-specific paths**: Absolute paths, specific directory names, or location-dependent information
- **Instance-specific identifiers**: User names, session IDs, timestamps, or other unique identifiers
- **Trivial state changes**: Minor formatting changes, temporary states, or cosmetic updates
- **Redundant information**: Multiple dynamics describing the same behavioral pattern with different specific values

### Keep dynamics that describe:
- **General behavioral patterns**: How functions typically behave across different environments
- **Error conditions**: Standard error messages and failure modes
- **State transitions**: General state changes (logged in/out, file created/deleted, etc.)
- **Function capabilities**: What functions can do, not what specific data they return
- **Function contains meaningful arguments**: Keep dynamics where the function call includes arguments that affect behavior or state, as these illustrate how input parameters influence outcomes.

## Guidelines
- **Output format**: Return a JSON array containing only the filtered dynamics
- **Preserve structure**: Keep the same JSON structure for remaining dynamics
- **Generalize descriptions**: Replace specific values with general descriptions where possible
- **Maintain accuracy**: Don't change the core meaning of the dynamics, only remove specificity
- **Focus on patterns**: Prioritize dynamics that show reusable behavioral patterns

## Examples

### Remove (Very environment-specific that it contains data entries specific to a environment instance):
```json
{
    "initial_state": "No user is logged into the system, and a list of users needs to be identified.",
    "action_taken": "list_users()",
    "environmental_dynamics": "Provides the list of available users: Alice, Bob, Catherine, and Daniel."
}
```

### Keep (General pattern and error message):
```json
{
    "initial_state": "No user is currently logged in.",
    "action_taken": "search_messages(keyword=\"test\")",
    "environmental_dynamics": "An error message is returned indicating that no user is currently logged in."
}
```

### Remove (Trivial transition):
```json
{
    "initial_state": "In a directory with existing files.",
    "action_taken": "ls()",
    "environmental_dynamics": "Returns a list of files and directories in the current location."
}
```

## Instructions
1. Analyze each environmental dynamic in the input JSON array
2. Apply the filtering criteria to determine if it should be kept or removed
3. For dynamics that are kept, generalize any remaining specific details
4. Return the filtered JSON array with only the significant, generalizable dynamics
