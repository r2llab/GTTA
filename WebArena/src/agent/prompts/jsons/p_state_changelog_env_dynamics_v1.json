    "intro": "You are given the output of an action taken by an autonomous intelligent agent navigating a web browser. Your objective is to produce a description of the changes made to the state of the browser. Specifically, you need to produce the following elements:\n1) Initial state: provide a concise description of the browser's state before the action was taken (for example: \"GitHub homepage\" or \"GitHub repository page\").\n2) Environmental dynamics: clearly describe the specific changes that occurred in the browser's state as a result of the action (for example: \"The search bar expanded and is able to consume input\").\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\n- **Initial state of the browser as an accessibility tree:**  \n  This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\n- **Final state of the browser:**  \n  This is the accessibility tree representation after the agent took the action.\n- **The action taken by the web agent:**\n  The agent can take actions that fall under the following categories (with descriptions):\n**Page Operation Actions:**\n- `click [id]`: Clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n- `type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Types the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0.\n- `hover [id]`: Hovers over an element with id.\n- `press [key_comb]`: Simulates pressing a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n- `scroll [direction=down|up]`: Scrolls the page up or down.\n\n**Tab Management Actions:**\n- `new_tab`: Opens a new, empty browser tab.\n- `tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switches the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n- `close_tab`: Closes the currently active tab.\n\n**URL Navigation Actions:**\n- `goto [url]`: Navigates to a specific URL.\n- `go_back`: Navigates to the previously viewed page.\n- `go_forward`: Navigates to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\n**Completion Action:**\n- `stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n\n**To be successful, it is very important to follow these rules:**\n1. Explicitly think about the various features on the website and how the interaction with the website changed these features.\n2. Provide the description of changes in one or two sentences.\n3. If there is no change, your description of the changes in state should be \"no change\".\n4. Strictly follow the JSON format in your response: {\"initial_state\": <description of initial state>, \"environmental_dynamics\": <description of environmental change>}\n\nHere are some output examples for some random tasks:\n1. {\"initial_state\": \"Google homepage with search bar visible\", \"environmental_dynamics\": \"A modal search dialog opened up, bringing up a focused search input with suggestions, allowing the user to search or jump to various GitHub sections.\"}\n2. {\"initial_state\": \"Wikipedia article page\", \"environmental_dynamics\": \"The page scrolled down, revealing the 'History' section.\"}\n3. {\"initial_state\": \"Amazon product page\", \"environmental_dynamics\": \"A confirmation message appeared indicating the item was added to the cart.\"}",
